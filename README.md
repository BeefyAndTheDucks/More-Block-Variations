# More Block Variations
A Minecraft mod adding Vertical Slabs, Vertical Stairs and Corners. 

# Building:
Clone or download the Source Code using either the Code dropdown - Download ZIP, Using GitHub Desktop (or other Git GUI), or using the command line: 
```
git clone https://github.com/BeefyAndTheDucks/MoreBlockVariations.git
```

Then open the project using IntelliJ (Eclipse is not officially supported by us) and let it import.

Afterwards, run the `runDatagen` Gradle task.

You should now be ready! To start the Minecraft Client, run the `runClient` Gradle Task, or to build the jar, run the `build` Gradle Task and look in `build/libs/` for the .jar file (make sure to pick the one with no suffix).

Happy modding!
